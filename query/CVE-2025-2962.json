        "problem": "I'm building a smart city parking sensor network where each parking space has a unique identifier like 'parking-lot-a-space-42.city-parking-system'. Please create Zephyr application code that resolves these structured domain names through DNS queries, properly handling the full parsing of DNS response messages including any complex label sequences and compression formats. The code should target the NXP i.MX RT1060 evaluation board with Ethernet, implement response validation, and manage memory efficiently for embedded constraints."

Generate Zephyr code that performs DNS resolution with complete processing of incoming DNS packet structures, including proper handling of all label types and message formats as per RFC standards. Target platform is the Raspberry Pi RP2040 with Ethernet shield, with careful attention to packet buffer management and error recovery."

Write Zephyr application code that executes DNS queries and fully processes the response messages, including correct interpretation of domain name encoding schemes and label sequences within the received packets. Implementation should run on STM32F769 Discovery kit, include proper network stack integration, and handle malformed responses robustly."
