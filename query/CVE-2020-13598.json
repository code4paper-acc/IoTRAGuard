        "problem": "As a Zephyr developer, design a sensor data logger for industrial monitoring where each sensor creates daily log files named 'sensor_X_YYYYMMDD.csv'. Implement a function to verify log file integrity before processing by checking: file existence and accessibility, confirming it's a file not a directory, ensuring size is reasonable (>0 bytes, <1MB), and obtaining exact file size for buffer allocation. If verification fails, log specific error details and skip processing. The solution must be thread-safe for multiple sensor checks, memory-efficient for embedded constraints, use only Zephyr RTOS APIs, and provide clear diagnostic error handling."
