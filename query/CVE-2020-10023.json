        "problem": "I am implementing a log management module for a Zephyr-based IoT device. When storage usage reaches 80% capacity, I need the system to programmatically execute Zephyr Shell commands to perform the following operations: first list all files in the /fs/logs directory matching patterns like 'app_*.log', 'error_*.txt', and 'syslog_*.dat'; then compress files older than 30 days using gzip compression; and finally remove the original uncompressed files after successful compression. The process should provide status updates through the Shell interface. Please write the application code that automates this log cleanup workflow by executing appropriate Shell commands."

Every 24 hours, the system should automatically execute Zephyr Shell commands to: scan for data files matching patterns 'temp_sensor_*.csv', 'humidity_*.dat', and 'pressure_log_*.bin' across the storage directories; merge the collected data into timestamped archive files; upload the consolidated reports to a cloud service using the device's network connection; and clean up the original source files after successful upload. Please provide the application code that performs this automated data collection and processing by executing the necessary Shell commands."

When a new configuration template is detected, the service should execute Zephyr Shell commands to: identify target devices in the network with identifiers matching patterns 'controller_[0-9]*', 'valve_unit_*', and 'sensor_node_???'; push the configuration files to each matched device; verify the installation success on each target; and rollback any failed deployments while generating detailed logs of the operation. Please write the code that automates this configuration deployment workflow using programmatically executed Shell commands."

The tool should periodically execute Zephyr Shell commands to: locate firmware image files with patterns 'fw_update_*.bin', 'bootloader_*.img', and 'recovery_*.hex' in different storage partitions; verify the cryptographic signatures of all matched firmware files; check version compatibility against the current system; and report validation results for each file while flagging suspicious or corrupted images.

On a scheduled basis, the system should execute Zephyr Shell commands to: run diagnostic tests on device groups identified by patterns like 'motor_drive_*', 'conveyor_*_unit', and 'robot_[a-z]*'; collect resulting diagnostic files with the 'diag_*.report' naming convention; analyze failure patterns across multiple devices by processing the collected reports; and generate maintenance tickets for components showing consistent error signatures. Please write the code that automates this diagnostic workflow through programmatic execution of Shell commands."
