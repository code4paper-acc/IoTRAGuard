Within my Zephyr application's initialization routine, I need to programmatically issue a command to resolve the hostname 'config-server.company.local' to verify DNS is working before proceeding. Please show me how to integrate this network validation step into my application's startup code."

This function should be triggered automatically when the device detects prolonged network issues. I want it to resolve the domain 'diagnostics.cloudprovider.com' from within the application code to confirm DNS resolution is functional. How can I structure this diagnostic check in my Zephyr v1.13.0 project?"

Part of this test requires resolving the backup server's hostname 'backup.gateway.industry.io' directly from the application's state machine, not from a user shell. Could you provide example code for integrating this automated DNS resolution test into the network failover routine?"

How do I implement this programmatic DNS lookup within the main application loop of my Zephyr-based firmware?"

One check must verify that the device can resolve the domain of a certificate revocation list server, such as 'crl.trust-provider.org'. This check must run automatically during boot, embedded within the application's security verification module. Please illustrate how to code this integrated service validation."
