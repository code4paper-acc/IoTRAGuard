        "problem": "I'm developing a smart home gateway that needs to resolve local device hostnames like 'thermostat.local' and 'lights.local' to their mDNS addresses. Please generate Zephyr RTOS application code that uses the DNS resolver API to query these .local domain names and handle potential CNAME chain resolutions efficiently. The code should run on an nRF52840 DK board, properly manage DNS query timeouts, and integrate with the system's network management."

        "problem": "I need to implement DNS-based service discovery for my industrial IoT sensor network where devices register with dynamic hostnames. Create a Zephyr application that periodically queries a central DNS server to resolve hostnames like 'sensor-floor3-rack2' to IP addresses, with robust error handling for when responses contain alias records that require follow-up queries. Target hardware is the STM32H747I-DISCO board with Ethernet connectivity."

Write Zephyr code that handles DNS queries for hostnames like 'truck-abc123.corp.example.com', including proper processing of DNS response messages that may contain compressed domain name formats. The application should work on Raspberry Pi Pico W with Wi-Fi and handle network interruptions gracefully."

Generate Zephyr application code that performs DNS resolution for medical equipment identifiers, processes incoming DNS packet responses that might include canonical name records, and caches results. Target platform is the Intel Apollo Lake with both Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces, requiring thread-safe implementation."

Develop Zephyr code that queries DNS for hostnames like 'moisture-sensor-field1', handles the complete parsing of DNS response messages including any name compression formats used in replies, and implements retry logic for unreliable networks. Hardware platform is the ESP32-S3 with cellular modem fallback support."
