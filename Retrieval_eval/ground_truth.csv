CVE_ID,TARGET_CHECK_STRING
CVE-2020-13598,Calling fs_stat on a file with a filename longer than 12 characters.The public API fs_stat() calls the library function fatfs_stat(), and there is a buffer overflow inside fatfs_stat(), where the struct fs_dirent is defined with MAX_FILE_NAME. Performing fs_stat on a file with a filename longer than 12 characters long will cause a buffer overflow.
CVE-2020-10023,The public API shell_execute_cmd calls the library function shell_spaces_trim, and there is a buffer overflow vulnerability inside shell_spaces_trim due to incorrect buffer size calculation when compressing consecutive spaces.
CVE-2023-4263,The public API radio_api->tx calls the driver function nrf5_tx, and there is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability inside nrf5_tx due to the missing bounds check on the length of net_buf parameter before memcpy.
CVE-2017-14199,The DNS callback function (dns_resolve_cb) may be called multiple times, leading to out-of-bounds array access and incorrect port number settings.
CVE-2017-14201,The shell command handler passed a stack-allocated structure containing a boolean flag to an asynchronous DNS callback, causing a use-after-free crash when the callback accessed the freed stack memory.
CVE-2017-14202,Improper allocation of memory for shell history items leading to potential buffer overflow.The SHELL_HISTORY_DEFINE macro under-allocates memory for command history entries, causing a heap buffer overflow when a long command is stored and later retrieved.
CVE-2020-10022,The library function probe_cb has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to missing bounds checks when copying network payloads, which is triggered when the device receives a malformed JSON response from an UpdateHub server.
CVE-2025-1675,The library function dns_copy_qname in dns_pack.c performs a memcpy from an untrusted DNS packet without proper bounds checking on the computed offset after processing a DNS compression pointer, allowing an out-of-bounds read when a malicious pointer redirects to a negative or invalid position.
CVE-2025-2962,The library function dns_copy_qname has an infinite loop vulnerability in DNS label parsing, which may be triggered when processing malicious DNS responses containing self-referential or circular compression pointers.
